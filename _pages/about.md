Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student at [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Grduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), advised by Prof. [Shu-tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I obtained my double degree of Intelligence Science and Technology B.E. & Finance B.Ec. from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). 


My reserach interests foucus on the low-level computer vision and AIGC.
