Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student at [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), advised by Prof. [Shu-tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). I also work closely with Prof. [Tao Dai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=MqJNdaAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I obtained my dual degree of B.Eng. & B.Ec. from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). 


My research interests focus on:

- **Generative Computer Vision**: trying to build a realistic digital world, such as image generation, image restoration, image super-resolution, etc.
- **Efficient Artificial Intelligence**: trying to allow AI available for everyone, such as parameter efficient fine-tuning, network quantization, sparsity, distillation, etc.
