Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master student at [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Grduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), advised by Prof. [Shu-tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Moreover, I also work closely with Prof. [Tao Dai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=MqJNdaAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Yawei Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=IFLsTGsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I obtained my double degree of Intelligence Science and Technology B.E. & Finance B.Ec. from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). 


My reserach interests foucus on:

- **Low-level Computer Vision**: trying to make the digital world more clear, such as image resotration, super-resolution, denoising, etc.
- **Efficient Artificial Intelligence**: trying to allow AI available for everyone, such as parameter effiiecnt fine-tuning, network quantization, knowledge distillation, etc.
